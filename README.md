Contributing to Madcoin (MDC)
==================================


The Madcoin project was born from a collective development community all wanting the 
same thing: The implementation of blockchain data to be stored in read-only memory rather than from  
disk. As a result, the eventual goal is to be able to run a compressed/pruned blockchain platform
from portable devices such as mobile phones and other NFC capable devices. The community believe
cache persistence in the blockchain is a vital milestone to truly write a ledger in the clouds.

Madcoin is not structured like conventional crypto-coins. Madcoin is governed and led soley by a  
Development Committee. Madcoin is a community coin (not-for-profit) available to everyone and 
one of the first successful crypto-coins to be absolutely community managed (self-managed
by the people). Madcoin is driven by a dedicated community of contributers yet controlled
by not one single individual. Every new direction is put to vote and decided by the Dev-Committee. 
This attractive Model will help ensure sovereignty, stability, growth, and compelling developments.
This also enables contributors to come and go on the project without commitment or constraint. 

Everyone in the dev-committee/team are part-time volunteers working to improve the crypto-landscape.
There are no paid developers and as a result the evolution of Madcoin has been remarkable.
If you are in the Development Committee/Team and you decide to leave the project for any reason, all 
premine and resources are expected to be passed onto a new committee member that the committee 
will vote to appoint. Nobody has a claim on Madcoin as it has always been the work of atleast six
or more people. As it requires a team to function, not one person can ever make decisions or control its vision.

In Madcoin there is no particular concept of "Core developers" in the sense of privileged people.
Open source often naturally revolves around meritocracy where longer term contributors
gain more trust from the developer community. These trusted people in Madcoin then
are historically voted by the community into the "Dev-committee" . From the Dev-Committee
there are repository "Dev-Premine-Managers" who are responsible for holding premine, 
managing chat servers, merging, moderation of committee and the appointment of new Dev members.

The manifesto of the Madcoin Community from inception is to better blockchain technology and to push the 
boundaries of on-chain storage and scaling. It is important to note that nobody is obligated to contribute to Madcoin. But the more people that contribute to its codebase, the better for the future of blockchain.


The Madcoin Committee should never have less than six members at any one time.
